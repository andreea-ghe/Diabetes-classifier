# Diabetes-classifier

- Machine learning library allowing *binary classification*.
- Various algorithms can be used: **KNN**, **Naive Bayes**, **Perceptron**, **Logistic Regression** or **Decision Tree**.
- All classifiers provide training and testing capabilities.
- The library offers various evaluation measures to test the performance of the algorithms: *accuracy*, *precision*, *recall*, *F1 score*, *confusion matrix*.
- The algorithms were tested using the [Pima Indians Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
- The GUI was created using JavaFX.
